# This repository contains Digital Signal Processing projects covering signal representation, sampling, spectral analysis, aliasing, and reconstruction. 
### **The first part** focuses on guided exercises to analyze signals in time and frequency domains. 
### **The second part** provides a more general approach where signal components and sampling parameters are defined as inputs, allowing automatic generation and analysis of sampled signals and their spectra, including ideal low-pass filtering.
